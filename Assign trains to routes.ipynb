    "The example below uses Google OR-tools to assign trains to routes. This is similar to the employee schedule problem found here: https://developers.google.com/optimization/scheduling/employee_scheduling\n",
    "\n",
    "The example shows how to assign 6 trains to 8 routes subject to the following constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each train must be used during the day and each route must be covered\n",
    "\n",
    "- A train can be assigned to a maximum of two routes per day\n",

    "- Where a train is assigned to two routes, the train's end of day cumulative kilometreage must not exceed 24,800 km\n",
    "\n",
    "- Where a train is assigned to two routes the timings of the individual routes must not overlap\n",
    "     \n",
    "- Trains with high cumulative kilometreage should be assigned to short routes and trains with low cumulative kilometreage should be assigned to long routes\n",
